# QCD @ FCCee
This repo tracks the progress of my research project studying QCD physics in 500 GeV electron-positron collisions in the FCCee. The analyses are mainly in C++ using the Pythia 8.312, ROOT 6.32.08, and FastJet 3.4.3 frameworks. Other studies include: partonic jet fractions in LHC collisions, and deriving comparative scalings between e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>-</sup>/p<sup>+</sup>p<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup>p<sup>+</sup> colliders.
